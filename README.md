A dynamic watch face that displays real-time heart rate information using the `MeasureClient` API.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a watch face designed to provide continuous updates on the user's heart rate. It leverages the `MeasureClient` API to fetch real-time data.

## Getting Started

To preview this watch face, make sure you have a Wear OS device with Health Services installed. Open the project in Android Studio, then deploy and select the watch face on your device.

On initial launch, the watch face will prompt the user for BODY SENSORS permission. Once granted, it will begin displaying the heart rate data.

Please note that this watch face has been tested using the Virtual Sensors option in the emulator settings.
